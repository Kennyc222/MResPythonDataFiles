This is a project for my Master of Research (MRes) at Macquarie University, a stepping stone of PhD ..This project is about the analysis of hierarchial star formation anaysis of 30 Dor next to the LMC, using another local Cluster for Westerlund 1 (Wd1) as a bracket

Here are the files for used: 

30 Dor (UMS, Upper Main Sequence Stars ) clusters only
30 Dor (UMS, Upper Main Sequence Stars and RGB, Red Giant Branch ) clusters 
30 Dor (UMS, Upper Main Sequence Stars ) clusters  TreeCorr (in ASCII format) only
30 Dor (UMS, Upper Main Sequence Stars and RGB, Red Giant Branch ) TreeCorr (in ASCII format) clusters 

Wd1 original distance
Wd1 in the LMC projected distance
simulated Wd1 with ideal clsuters in terms of stars distribution at the original distance

I have both mofified TreeCorr and HaloTools, feel free to use them!
